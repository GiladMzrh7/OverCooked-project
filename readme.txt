hi and welcome to my overcooked project!
to run the script and test it you need to:
1. run the server.py file
2. run the mains.py file

if you want to play in multiple computers  you need to change the ip written in the 21st line to your own computer ip than run the mains.py

pay attention that to run the script you will need most of the files below so make sure you transfer all of them
